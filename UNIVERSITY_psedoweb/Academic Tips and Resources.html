     <h2>Time Management</h2>
<li>
    <ul>Use a Planner</ul>
Benefits of Planning: Writing down deadlines, assignments, and important dates in a planner keeps all your commitments visible and manageable. This helps reduce anxiety because you won't have to worry about forgetting important tasks.
Tips for Effective Use:
Choose a planner format that works for you—digital (apps like Google Calendar or Todoist) or physical (a traditional planner).
Review your planner weekly to adjust priorities and check for upcoming deadlines, ensuring you remain on track.
<ul>Pomodoro Technique</ul>
What is It?: The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo. It boosts productivity by breaking work into intervals.
How to Implement:
Set a timer for 25 minutes and focus solely on the task at hand. After the timer goes off, take a 5-minute break to recharge.
After completing four Pomodoros, take a longer break (15-30 minutes) to prevent burnout.
Benefits: This method helps maintain focus, improves concentration, and can aid in better retention of information when studying.
<ul>Set Daily Goals</ul>
Why Set Goals?: Setting specific, achievable daily goals can help prioritize your tasks and keep you focused, reducing the chance of feeling overwhelmed.
How to Choose Goals:
At the beginning of each day, identify the top three tasks that will have the most significant impact on your studies or assignments.
Keep these goals visible, either on your planner or as reminders on your phone, creating accountability for yourself.
</li>
<h2>Active Learning</h2>
    <ul>Take Notes Effectively</ul>
Importance of Note-Taking: Effective note-taking enhances understanding and retention of complex material.
Cornell Method:
Divide your page into three sections:
Cues: Write questions or keywords on the left side.
Notes: Use the larger right side for detailed notes during lectures or reading.
Summary: At the bottom, write a short summary of the material covered.
This format encourages active engagement with the material and makes review more efficient by allowing you to focus on key points and concepts.
    <ul>Engage with the Material</ul>
Active Engagement: Simply reading material passively is less effective than actively engaging with it.
Techniques for Engagement:
Ask Questions: Challenge yourself to ask questions about the material, such as the “how” and “why” behind concepts. This promotes deeper understanding.
Summarization: After studying a section, try to summarize what you’ve learned in your own words. This practice reinforces comprehension.
Teaching Others: Teach the concepts to a friend or a study group. Explaining material to others requires you to simplify complex information, solidifying your own understanding.
